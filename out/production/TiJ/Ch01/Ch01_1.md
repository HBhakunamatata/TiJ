## Ch01 Everything is an Object

1.Everything is an object
- We use the object with a pointer (or a reference)

2.You must create an object.(new)
- where to store the object
    >- register
    >- stack
    >- heap
    >- static
    >- Serialization

- (1) We new an object on the _heap_  
    we get _flexible_ programs in trade of the run time.

- (2) We use primitive type on the _stack_
    >- boolean byte char short int long float double void 
    >-  1 bit    1    2    2    4    8    4     8        
    >- we get _efficient_ programs because of its usual use.
    
3.New an object Array
- J use some safe way in case of trouble in C++.
- (1) Array out of bound
- out of bound exception ---> range checking 
- (2) without typing checking 
- object initials to be null / primitive type initials to be 0
    ---> typing checking
- In short, both of the checking will waste run time.

4. You do not need to destroy an object
- scope
- you can not use the reference after the end of scope.(Both java and C++)

- In C++, you need to destroy the objects in care of leak of memory
- In java , we have a _gc_ to release the memory after the scope

5.Create a class
- A _class_ is to tell how the class of object looks and behaves.
- Field & Method
    - field : 
        - the default value of primitive type (pic)
    - method : mehtod determine the message an object can receive
        - name / argument / return type / body
        - _An method can be called only for an object_(except static method)

6. static keyword
- (1) Two time for use
    - multi object use the same storage
    - if you need a method without creating an object / 
- (2) Two ways to use
    - ClassName.StaticMethod  (Preferred)
    - ObjectName.StaticMethod
