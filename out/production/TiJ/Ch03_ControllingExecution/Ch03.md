## Ch03

- Like smart creature, programs must manipulate its world 
    and make choices during execution. In .. you make choice 
    with the controlling execution.
    
1. Foreach Syntax
- It is a succinct syntax for iteration of array and collection.
- It is designed as _iterator-lying_ implementation.
- So it run faster in collection than in array (based on index)
- but it can not be used to remove object because it hide iterator
- eg

2. range()

3. labeled continue / labeled break
- labeled continue:  continue labelName   break the nest loop but start the outer loop
- labeled break:     break lableName      break the nest loop not reenter the outer loop

- The only reason to use labels in J is when you have nested loops 
    and you want to break or continue through more than one nested level. 
- The only place a label is useful in J is _right before_ an iteration statement.
