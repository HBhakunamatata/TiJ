## Reuse the code
- Issue: To reuse the code without soiling exciting codes
- Approaches : Composition & Inheritance
    - C: creating new class composed of objects of the existing class
    - I: creating new class and add some new code in it
    
    - reuse the function / reuse the form
    - the same : they both make new type from the existing type

1.Composition Syntax
- eg : SprinklerSystem
- toString() : when you print an object as String, it will call toString auto.
- Take care of the reference initialized in the new class
    - (1) at the definition
    - (2) at the constructor
    - (3) instance initialization
    - (4) when using (lazy initialization)
    - eg Bath

2. Inheritance Syntax
- eg : Cleaner and Detergent
- each main() in each class
    - each class can have its own main() for easy testing
    - Command line ---> class name ---> main()  
            the class need not be __public__
    
3.Initializing the base class : call constructors
- The only way to get the derived obj is to call the base class constructor.
- eg : Cartoon

- Default constructor & constructors with arguments

4.Delegation
- Delegation is midway of inheritance and composition.
- Delegation contains objects but can choose to expose a subset of methods
- eg. SpaceShip

5.NameHiding (important) 
- The _overloading_ methods will _not_ hide the methods in the base class.
- The overloading works regardless of whether the method was defined 
    in the derived class or the base class.
- eg. Hide

6. How to choose Inheritance & Composition
- C : want the features of existing class instead of its interface
- I : ask whether you need to up-cast from new class to base class

- C : The 'is a' relationship is expressed with inheritance
- I : The 'has a' relationship is expressed with composition

7. Upcasting
- The new class is a type of the existing class.
- eg. Wind

8. final  (This cannot be changed in general)
- Reason : Design & Efficiency

- (1) final data = constant
    - fold into calculation at compile time, estimating run time
    - It can be a value cached at the run time that won't changed
    
    - Final value must be initialized in the definition and constructor
    
    - Value must be primitive and expressed with 'final'
    - When used to _reference_, once the reference points to an object,
      the reference can not be changed. But the object that the reference
      points to still can change.
    
- (2) blank final 
    - You’re forced to perform assignments to finals 
      either with an expression at the point of
      definition of the field or in every constructor. 
      That way it’s guaranteed that the final field is
      always initialized before use. 
    - eg. BlankFinal

- (3) final argument
    - final argument means you cannot change what the argument reference points to

- (4) final methods (reason)
    - put a "lock" on the methods to prevent inheriting class from changing
    - efficiency: replace the method call with copy of the actual method code

- (5) final & private
    - eg 
    - Private methods are implicitly final . 
        On a related note, a subclass can declare a field or method 
        with the same name as a private field or method in a super class, 
        because from the subclass's point of view, these members do not exist. 
        There's no special relationship between these members.

- (6) final class
    - It means the design of class will never need to be changed.
        - field: as usual
        - method: implicitly final
        
9. Initialization with inheritance (important)
- eg. Beetle 

- final总结  
final 关键字可以用于成员变量、本地变量、方法以及类
final 成员变量必须在声明的时候初始化或者在构造器中初始化，否则就汇报编译错误
不能够对 final 变量再次赋值
本地变量必须在声明时赋值
在匿名类中所有变量都必须是 final 变量
final 方法不能被重写
final 类不能被继承
接口中声明的所有变量本身是 final 的
final 和 abstract 这两个关键字是反相关的，final 类就不可能是 abstract 的
没有在声明时初始化 final 变量的称为空白 final 变量(blank final variable)，它们必须在构造器中初始化，或者调用 this() 初始化，不这么做的话，编译器会报错final变量(变量名)需要进行初始化
按照 Java 代码惯例，final 变量就是常量，而且通常常量名要大写
对于集合对象声明为 final 指的是引用不能被更改
