- Interface and abstract class provide more structured way to separate 
    interface from implementation.
- Degree of separation : 
    Ordinary class > Abstract class > Pure interface

## Abstract class & methods
- Issue: establish common interface so that it can be express differently
- Solution : _Abstract_ method & _Abstract_ class
    (Abstract class is called these class containing abstract method)
- use(Compiler complain)
    - abstract class is only for derived class, creating object is no need
    - The class containing the abstract methods must be called 'abstract'
- useful
    - (1)they make the abstract class explicitly, and tell both user and
           compiler how to use
    - (2)useful refactoring toll, since they allow you to move common 
            interface up the inheritance hierarchy
