# Arrays

- We need to perform some more sophisticated operators on arrays, 
   and evaluate the use of an array vs. container.

## Why arrays are special

- There are three issues that distinguish arrays from other containers: 
    _efficiency, type and the ability of holding primitive_.
- The array is Java's most efficient way to store and randomly access a sequence of Object.
- Demo : CollectionComparison.java

## Arrays are first-class objects

- Regardless of what type of array you’re working with, the array identifier is actually _a reference to a true object_ that’s created on the heap.
- This is the _object_ that holds the references to the other objects
- Demo : ArrayOption.java

## Returning an array

- Demo : IceCream.java

## Multidimensional arrays

- MultidimensionalPrimitiveArray.java
- Arrays.deepToString() turns multidimensional arrays into Strings.

## Arrays and Generics

- We cannot initialize the generic arrays.
- Erasure removes the parameter type information so compiler 
  cannot know the exact type of elements in order to force type safety.
> Peel <Banana> [] peels = new Peel<> [10]; // illegal
- Thus we cannnot initialize the generic arrays, however you can create the reference of generic array.
> List <String> [] ls;  // legal

- Demo : ParameterizedArrayType.java
