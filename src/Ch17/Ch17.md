# Ch17 I/O

- Creating a good input/output (I/O) system is one of the most difficult task
  for language designer. This is evidenced by the number of different approaches.

## The __File__ class

- The __File__ class represents the path of files. That is:
    - it can be the name of a particular file.
    - it can also be the names of a set of files in a directory.
    
- FileNameFilter : accept()  

A class that tells how to select the File objects for display.
- Demo : FileDir.java
This is an ideal example for rewriting to using an anonymous class.(tightly bound to DirList2)
- Demo : FileDir2.java
