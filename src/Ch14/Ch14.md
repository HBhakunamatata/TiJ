# Generics

- Ordinary classes and methods work with specific types:  either
  primitive or class types. If you are writing code that might be
  used acrross more types, this rigidity can be overconstraining.

- Methods to allow generation
    - (1) Polymorphism ---> classes
        The single hierarchy is overconstraining.
    - (2) any class implements ---> interface
        more general code with no specific type
    - (3)                  ---> Generics

## Generics (Parameterized types)

- It means "pertaining or appropriate to large groups of classes."
- The original intent of generics was to allow the programmer 
  the greatest amount of expressiveness possible when writing 
  classes or methods, by loosening the constraints on the types.
- It happens in compile time.

## Comparison with C++ (Reason)

- 1.Understanding C++ templates will help you understand the concepts
    and limitation of Generics.
- 2.There is significant misunderstanding about C++ template.

## Simple Generics

- One of the most compelling initial motivation is to create _container_ class.
    - We need a more reusable container holding the specific type of objects.
    - Demo :             Holder1.java               Holder2.java   
- Demo : Holder3.java
- The core idea of Generics is that you tell it what type you want to use, 
    and it takes care of the details.
- When you specify the type in <>, you are only allowed to put objects of that type or subtype.
    And when you get a value out, it is automatically the right type.
    
### A tuple library

- When you want to return multiple objects from a method call, you need a holder to contain them.
- This concept is called a tuple : some objects wrapped together.
- When you get the tuple, you can only read the objects but you cannot change them.
- Tuples can typically be any length, but each object in the tuple can be of a different type.
- However, we want to speicfy the type of the objects and the recipient to get the right type.
- Demo : TwoMemTuple.java / ThreeMemTuple.java .... 
- Note
    - 1.final : cannot change members only to create a new tuple (safety)
    - 2.public : client cannot change them because of 1(final)  
                which reducing the getter and setter.

(__Important Note : Why cannot initialize a generics type array?__)
- It's because Java's arrays (unlike generics), at runtime, information about its component type.
  So you must know the component type when you create the array. 
  Since you don't know what T is at runtime, you can't create the array.
- And what about ArrayList<T>?  
> Object []
