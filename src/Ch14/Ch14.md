# Generics

- Ordinary classes and methods work with specific types: either
  primitive or class types. If you are writing code that might be
  used across more types, this rigidity can be overconstrained.

- Methods to allow generation
    - (1) Polymorphism ---> classes
        The single hierarchy is overconstrained.
    - (2) any class implements ---> interface
        more general code with no specific type
    - (3)                  ---> Generics

## Generics (Parameterized types)

- It means "pertaining or appropriate to large groups of classes."
- The original intent of generics was to allow the programmer 
  the greatest amount of expressiveness possible when writing 
  classes or methods, by loosening the constraints on the types.
- It happens in _compile time_.

## Comparison with C++ (Reason)

- 1.Understanding C++ templates will help you understand the concepts
    and limitation of Generics.
- 2.There is significant misunderstanding about C++ template.

## Simple Generics

- One of the most compelling initial motivation is to create _container_ class.
    - We need a _more reusable container_ holding the _specific type_ of objects.
    - Demo :           Holder1.java                     Holder2.java
- Demo : Holder3.java

- The core idea of Generics is that you tell it what type you want to use, 
    and it takes care of the details.
- When you specify the type in <>, you are only allowed to put objects of that type or subtype,  
    And when you get a value out, it is automatically the right type.
    
### A tuple library

- When you want to return multiple objects from a method call, you need a holder to contain them.
- This concept called tuple : some objects wrapped together.
- When you get the tuple, you can only read the objects however you cannot change them.
- Tuples can be any length, but each object in the tuple can be of a different type.
- However, if we want to specify the type of these objects, the recipient will get the right type.
- Demo : TwoMemTuple.java / ThreeMemTuple.java .... 
- Note
    - 1.final : cannot change members only to create a new tuple (safety)
    - 2.public : client cannot change them because of 1(final)  
                which reducing the getter and setter.

(__Important Note : Why cannot initialize a generics type array?__just like: T[])
- It's because Java's arrays (unlike generics), at runtime, information about its component type.
  So you must know the component type when you create the array. 
  Since you don't know what T is at runtime, you can't create the array.
- And what about ArrayList<T>?  
> Object [] 

### A Stack library

- Demo : LinkedStack.java

- By the way, inner class has access to the generic type parameters of its outer class.
