# Generics

- Ordinary classes and methods work with specific types:  either
  primitive or class types. If you are writing code that might be
  used acrross more types, this rigidity can be overconstraining.

- Methods to allow generation
    - (1) Polymorphism ---> classes
        The single hierarchy is overconstraining.
    - (2) any class implements ---> interface
        more general code with no specific type
    - (3)                  ---> Generics

## Generics (Parameterized types)

- It means "pertaining or appropriate to large groups of classes."
- The original intent of generics was to allow the programmer 
  the greatest amount of expressiveness possible when writing 
  classes or methods, by loosening the constraints on the types.
- It happens in compile time.

## Comparison with C++ (Reason)

- 1.Understanding C++ templates will help you understand the concepts
    and limitation of Generics.
- 2.There is significant misunderstanding about C++ template.

## Simple Generics

- One of the most compelling initial motivation is to create _container_ class.
