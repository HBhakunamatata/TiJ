/*
Add a class with a dispose() method to the previous exercise.
Modify FailingConstructor so that the constructor creates
one of these disposable objects as a member object,
after which the constructor might throw an exception,
after which it creates a second disposable member object.
Write code to properly guard against failure,
and in main() verify that all possible failure situations are covered.
