## CH02 Operator

- In lowest level, data in J is manipulated by operator.
- Almost most operator manipulates the primitive type 
            (except == != = + +=)
>- we use them at the same time we get the _side effect_.
>- Most operators are the same as those in C++, so we just record the differ

1.Assignment = 
- assignment is to assign a physical space to store the value.
    - lvalue : variable
    - rcalue : constant value / variable / expression
- To primitive type : just copy the value
- To object : copy the reference
    - the _aliasing issue_ when using or calling a method (two eg.s)

2.Relation operator
- == & (equals in class) and (equals in new class)
- eg.

3.String operator (+ ,+=)
- J do not support operator overload because it lead some complex feature
- syntax sweet
>- (1)we first convert into string then concatenate when a string "+"
>- (2)we use "+" without thinking the order (as long as there is a string)
- eg.

4.Promotion
- if you perform any mathematical or bitwise operations on primitive types 
that are smaller than an int (that is, char, byte, or short), 
those values will be promoted to int before performing the operations,
and the resulting value will be of type int.

So if you want to assign back into the smaller type, you must use a cast.
(since you assign back into a smaller type, you might lose information.) 

- In general, the largest data type in an expression is the one 
that determines the size of the result of that expression;
(if you multiply a float and a double, the result will be double; 
 if you add an int and a long, the result will be long.) 
 
5.no-sizeof
- because all primitive type has the same size in difference machine
