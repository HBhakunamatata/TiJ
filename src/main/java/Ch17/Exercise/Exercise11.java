/*
 * In the innerclasses/GreenhouseController.java example,
 * GreenhouseController contains a hard-coded set of events.
 * Change the program so that it reads the events and
 * their relative times from a text file, ((difficulty level 8):
 * Use a Factory Method design pattern to build the eventsâ€”see
 * Thinking in Patterns (with Java) at www.MindView.net.)
