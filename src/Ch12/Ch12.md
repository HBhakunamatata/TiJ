# Strings

## Immutable Strings

- The objects of String is immutable.
- Every method modifying a String actually creates and return a
    brand new String containing the modification. (important)
- Demo : Immutable.java
- __Note (important)__  
When q is passed in to upcase()  
itâ€™s actually __a copy of the reference to q__.  
The object this reference is connected to stays in 
__a single physical location__.  
The references are copied as they are passed around.

## StringBuilder vs. Overloading "+"

- Immutability has many efficiency issues.
    - You can alias to a String as many times as you want
    - No worry that one reference effect other reference

- A Demo for the benefit : Concatenation.java

- The difference of StringBuilder and Overloading '+'
    - Example : WhitherStringBuilder.java
    - Run 
    ```
        javap -c WhitherStringBuilder
    ```
    in the directory that contains .class files after compiling.
    - Overloading '+' implicitly creates a object of StringBuilder _every time_ called. 
    - So you will find the time point and quantity of StringBuilder's objects are different.

- After the comparision, the conclusion:
    - For simple ones, just use "+";
    - If a loop involved, you should use a StringBuilder explicitly.
    - Demo : UsingStringBuilder.java
