# Type Information

- Runtime type information (RTTI) allows you to discover and 
    use type information when a program is running.

- This chapter looks at the ways that Java allows you to discover 
  information about objects and classes at run time.
- It frees you from the constraint of doing type-oriented things 
  only at compile time, and can enable some very powerful programs. 
- The need for RTTI uncovers a plethora of 00 design issues, 
  and raises fundamental questions about how to structure your programs. 
- Two Forms
    - "traditional" RTTI : you have all the types available at compile time
    - Reflection mechanism : allows you to discover and use class information at run time.

## The need for RTTI

- The goal for OOP is to manipulate reference to the based type.
