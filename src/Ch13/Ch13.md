# Type Information

- Runtime type information (RTTI) allows you to discover and 
    use type information when a program is running.

- This chapter looks at the ways that Java allows you to discover 
  information about objects and classes at run time.
- It frees you from the constraint of doing type-oriented things 
  only at compile time, and can enable some very powerful programs. 
- The need for RTTI uncovers a plethora of 00 design issues, 
  and raises fundamental questions about how to structure your programs. 
- Two Forms
    - "traditional" RTTI : you have all the types available at compile time
    - Reflection mechanism : allows you to discover and use class information at run time.

## The need for RTTI

- The goal for OOP is to manipulate reference to the based type.

## The Class object

- Java perform RTTI using the Class object, which is used to create objects
    and contains all information about class, even if you are doing something like _cast_
- Class object is created when you write and compile a new class.
- JVM uses _class loader_ to load .class file and create objects.
- All classes are load dynamically when the program makes the first reference 
    to a __static__ member(constructor) of the class. (_important_)
- Thus, a Java program is partially loaded when necessary.(_dynamic loading_)
- Demo : SweetShop.java

- Anytime you want to use type information at run time, 
  you must first get a reference to the appropriate Class object.
    - Without object : static forName(String className) --> Class
    - access object : object.getClass --> Class
