# Enumerated Types

- The __enum__ keyword allows you to create a new type 
with a restricted set of named values, and to treat 
those values as regular program components.  
(Both the class constructure and the instances are in enum)

## 1. Basic enum features

- When you create an enum, an associated class is produced by compiler and 
  it is inherited automatically from java.lang.Enum.

- values() : return an array of constants in order of they declared
- ordinal() : return the declaration order of number
- == equals() hashcode() : enum creates hashcode() and equals() automatically.
- compare() : enum implements the Comparable and Serialization.

- Demo : EnumClass.java

### Using static import with enum

- It is a convienent way to create a static enum type instead of creating instance.
- Demo : Burrito.java

## 2.Adding methods to an enum

- Except you cannot inherit from an enum, you can treat enum as a regular class.
- So you can provide different description for each instance with a toString() method.
- Demo : OzWitch.java

- Note :
    - Youâ€™ll get a compile-time error if you try to define them after any of the methods or fields.
    - Compiler forbids you to use the constructor except for creating instances in enum
        (no matter whether it is a private or public).

## 3. enums in switch statements

- Demo : TrafficLight.java
