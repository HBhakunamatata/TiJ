# Enumerated Types

- The __enum__ keyword allows you to create a new type 
with a restricted set of named values, and to treat 
those values as regular program components.  
(Both the class constructure and the instances are in enum)

## 1. Basic enum features

- When you create an enum, an associated class is produced by compiler and 
  it is inherited automatically from java.lang.Enum.

- values() : return an array of constants in order of they declared
- ordinal() : return the declaration order of number
- == equals() hashcode() : enum creates hashcode() and equals() automatically.
- compare() : enum implements the Comparable and Serialization.

- Demo : EnumClass.java

### Using static import with enum

- It is a convienent way to create a static enum type instead of creating instance.
- Demo : Burrito.java

## 2.Adding methods to an enum

- Except you cannot inherit from an enum, you can treat enum as a regular class.
- So you can provide different description for each instance with a toString() method.
- Demo : OzWitch.java

- Note :
    - Youâ€™ll get a compile-time error if you try to define them after any of the methods or fields.
    - Compiler forbids you to use the constructor except for creating instances in enum
        (no matter whether it is a private or public).

## 3. enums in switch statements

- Demo : TrafficLight.java

## 4. The mystery of values()

- value() and valueOf(String) is added by the compiler automatically 
  when creating the enum instance.
- Demo : Reflection.java  (Because of erasure, compiler only knows Enum instead of Enum<?>)

```
// Compiled from "Reflection.java"
final class Explore extends java.lang.Enum{
    public static final Explore HERE;
    public static final Explore THERE;
    public static final Explore[] values();
    public static Explore valueOf(java.lang.String);
    static {};
}
```

- So you cannot call values() if you upcast to enum, but you can be access to
  them with getEnumConstances() in Class.
- If there is no constance in class, you will get a NullPointerException.
- Demo : UpcastEnum.java


## 5. Implement not extend

- Since enum cannot be extended and Java does not support multi-inheritance.
However, you can implement several interfaces.
- Demo : CartoonCharacter.java

## 6. Using interfaces for group

- The motivation for inheriting from an enum comes partly from 
    - wanting to extend the element in origin enum
    - wanting to create subcategories by using subtypes
- However, in practice you need to achieve categorization by grouping the elements
    together inside an interface and creating the enumeration based on the interface.
- If you want an enum of enums, you can create an enum with each instance for each enum.
- Demo : Food.java / TypeOfFood.java / Course.java 
- Promotion : There is a version that combine the above two kind into one tight way.
- Demo : SecurityCategory.java
