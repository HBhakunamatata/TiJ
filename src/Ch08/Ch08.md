- Interface and abstract class provide more structured way to separate 
    interface from implementation.
- Degree of separation : 
    Ordinary class > Abstract class > Pure interface

## Abstract class & methods
- Issue: establish common interface so that it can be express differently
- Solution : _Abstract_ method & _Abstract_ class
    (Abstract class is called these class containing abstract method)
- use(Compiler complain)
    - abstract class is only for derived class, creating object is no need
    - The class containing the abstract methods must be called 'abstract'
- useful
    - (1)they make the abstract class explicitly, and tell both user and
           compiler how to use
    - (2)useful refactoring toll, since they allow you to move common 
            interface up the inheritance hierarchy

## Interface
- The interface keyword produces a completely abstract class, 
    one that has no implementation at all.
- interface only provides a form or a protocol between based and derived
- "All classes that implement this interface will look like this form."
- *multiple inheritance: creating a class that ca upcast to to more that one class

- Components (forced)
    - interface : public / package access
    - field : public / static / final
    - method : public ???

- Complete decouple
    - demo:Processor

- *class without inheritance interface
- use adapter 
- demo: FilterAdapter

## initializing field in interface
- field cannot be 'blank final' but non-constant expression
- field are not part of interface, they are stored in the static area.

## multiple inheritance
- An interface has no implementation --> no storage associated with interface
    --> nothing to prevent many interface from being combined

- | Based class | Interface A | Interface B | ... | ...
- the derived class can upcast to any interfaces because all interfaces are dependent
- demo : Adventure
- useful
    - (1) to upcast to more than one based type(and flexibility that brings)
    - (2) to prevent the client from instancing an object 
            and to establish that it is only an interface

## extending an interface with inheritance
- You can easily add new method declarations to an interface
    by using inheritance several interfaces 
    so you will get a new interface with inheritance.
- demo:HorrorShow

## Name collision when combining Interface
- pitfall pic
- demo:InterfaceCollision

- Do not use the same method signature between interface and derived class\

## Adapting to an interface
- a method can accept an interface, leaving it up to you...
- example : Readable ---> Scanner 

## Nesting Interface
- A pic
- Interface can be 'private' in a class body but can implement as a public class
- Implementing a private interface is a way to force the definition of methods in
    that interface without adding type information (No casting)
- demo: NestingInterface
