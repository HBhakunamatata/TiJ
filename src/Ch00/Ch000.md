1.J is a program.
Program is to manage the complexity of hardware and software.
     Machine < ------- > Design 
"J cares about reducing the time and complexity of producing codes."

2.J is not a collection of feature.
You can not know the sum only if you think it in __Design__.
The trouble in general ---> The solution in J ---> The feature of J  

3.The Progress of Abstract
Trouble Space < ------- > Solution Space
The program plays the map between the trouble space and solution space.
In other words, it plays the middle model of Design and Machine.

Assemble ---> C/C++ ---> OOP
OOP intends to hide the underlying machine.

4.Object
> - Everything is an object
> - Objects tell others what to do by sending messages

> - Class is the type of the object
> - Objects with the same class can receive the same message

> - Object can be composed of other objects

- (More importantly) In some extent, oop isolate the user and lib as the client and server
- We treat the object as a ___web service___, it just communication
with the __interface__.
- And the client just use your interface to accomplish work.

5.Implementation of Hidden : Access Control
- The reasons
> - Prevent the client programmer to modify something in lib they should not touch (just a service)
> - The programmer can change the internal without worrying about what it will effect the client 

6.Reuse the Implementation : Component

7.Reuse the Interface : Inheritance
- Inheritance is a kind of clone. so programmer do not need write too many similar class.
- The similarity
    The based class and derived class has the same characters and behavious.
- the difference 
    >1.Add new characters and behaviors 
    >2.Change the inherited character and behaviors (Override)
- __is a__ vs. __is like a__

8.Polymorphism
- In some situations where we do not need to know the special class
- _Upcasting_: We treat the derived class as the based class 
- (easy to extend a new class of based class without changing the code)

- Issue : How the compiler know function call to a special class.
- Approach : _late binding_ 
    - (Compiler do not know the special class
       Write some code to calculate address of method in the run time)

9.The singly rooted hierarchy
- in my opinion, this is a tree to organize the structure of all classes
- (1)every object has functions and interface in common
- (2)it is easy to send message to every object
- (3)*** makes it easier to implement ___gc___

10.Container
- we need an Object to help us to manage
        how many space objects take and 
        how much time objects last.

11.Parameterized types (generics) 
- In original design, Container can hold all _Object_.(Upcasting)
- when runtime we need to _downcasting_ the Object.

- But the time of downcasting and type-checking too high.

12.Object creation and lifetime
- One critical issue is the way Objects are created and destroyed
- Issue becomes complicated when objects is multi-referenced

- Space: static store / dynamic store (heap) 
- Lifetime: static / dynamic destroy (GC) 
- gc only intends to release the memory on the heap
