## Thinking in Java Note

- The repository is to store the note when I read 'Thinking in Java'
- The repository is organized in the order of chapters in book
- In every chapter, I wrote a markdown file to summary what I studied
    and a directory 'Exercise' containing exercising codes
- In the future, I will read more books about Java and develop repository
    about them
